This application has two main purposes. First, is an inventory of my model car collection! Second, a simple utility for classifying any model car using modern cloud computer vision techniques. 


(Hidden third purpose: Motivator to finally learn ReactJS and GCP)

## Frontend
The frontend uses client-sided React compiled with Babel. It uses the bootstrap framework. Every component is carefully outlined in React to promote reusability with minimal state coupling.

## Backend
All the images are stored on Google Cloud Storage. The metadata for each image is stored on a Firestore powered by Firebase. 


Lastly, the actual backend logic is written in Typescript and is running as a function on GCP (Google Cloud Platform). 

## Computer Vision
To-be-determined ....
